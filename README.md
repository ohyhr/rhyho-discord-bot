# rhyho-discord-bot
My first discord bot, this is being built as one of my side projects during my spare time. 
I plan on adding a few features into the bot at first and then maybe expanding upon it in the future.
My current plans are:

    Logs
    Welcome Messages
    General Commands
    Twitch/YouTube Alerts
    Role selection via reactions
    Fetch images/gifs from reddit or imgur
    Music
    Chat levels
    Word counter
    Russian Roulette
    Gambling with chat points

I might aim to do more in the future but I am at least hoping to at least do 6 of them.
Was originally going to use discord.py but since it is no longer being supported I transistioned to Hikari.
